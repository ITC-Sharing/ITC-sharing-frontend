/**
 * Shapes returned by the /admin endpoints.
 *
 * These are bespoke payloads assembled in AdminService, not entities — the
 * backend picks specific fields per screen. Written out here because the admin
 * views previously held them as `ref<any[]>`, which meant a renamed field
 * produced a blank column at runtime instead of a build error.
 *
 * Derived from admin.service.ts. If a payload there changes, change it here
 * too — a mismatch is the one thing this file cannot catch on its own.
