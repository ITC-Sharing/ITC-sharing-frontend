# ── Why a script and not a static conf ───────────────────────────────────────
# Three of the CSP's sources are deployment facts, not code facts: where the API
# lives, where object storage lives, and whether either is HTTPS. Baking them
# into the image would mean a rebuild per environment, and writing them by hand
# per environment means the WebSocket origin gets forgotten — the SPA keeps
# working, notifications silently stop, and nobody connects the two.
#
# Run by the nginx image's own entrypoint, which executes /docker-entrypoint.d/*.sh
# in order before starting the server.

# Each source below is here because something in the app needs it:
#
#   script-src 'self'      Vite emits hashed module scripts and no inline
#                          script — the built index.html has none, so no nonce
#                          and no 'unsafe-inline'. Note: pdf.js ships WASM
#                          decoders for JPEG2000/JBIG2, but nothing configures
#                          wasmUrl and no .wasm is emitted into the bundle. If
#                          that is ever wired up, this needs 'wasm-unsafe-eval'.
#   style-src 'self'       All CSS is a build-time stylesheet. pdf.js does append
#                          a <style> element, but leaves it empty and fills it
#                          through CSSOM insertRule, which CSP does not govern —
#                          so this does NOT need 'unsafe-inline'. Vue's :style
#                          bindings are CSSOM too.
#   img-src  data:         An inline SVG data URI in the preview modal.
#            blob:         Local previews of a file the user just picked.
#            storage       Avatars, book covers, subject covers, department logos.
#   font-src 'self' data:  Nunito is bundled; data: is pdf.js's fallback path for
#                          fonts embedded in a PDF.
#   connect-src            XHR to the API, the Socket.IO upgrade, and pdf.js
#                          fetching PDF bytes straight from storage.
#   worker-src 'self'      The pdf.js worker is emitted as a same-origin asset.
#            blob:         pdf.js's wrapper path, used if the worker ever moves
#                          cross-origin.
#   object-src             Document previews are <object type="application/pdf">.
#   frame-src              BOTH are required, and this was the bug: an earlier
#                          version set only object-src, on the reasoning that an
#                          <object> is not an <iframe>. Chrome disagrees — it
#                          renders a PDF <object> in a nested browsing context
#                          and checks frame-src too, so the preview was refused
#                          with "Framing ... violates default-src 'none'" while
#                          object-src allowed it. 'self' is harmless in both:
#                          this origin serves only the static build, and every
#                          upload lives in storage.
#
# Everything else falls through to default-src 'none': no media, no manifest,
# no <base>, nothing.
